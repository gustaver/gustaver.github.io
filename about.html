  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm Gustave Rousselet. <b>Professionally</b> I'm a programmer who's enthusiastic about functional programming, especially Clojure.
    <b>Educationally</b> I'm a Computer Science student with a BSc in Computer Science and MSc in Machine Learning from KTH. <b>Most importantly</b> though,
    I'm just a dude who likes surfing, snowboarding, photography, travelling, and a bunch of other stuff. This website is my way of documenting 
    all these things.
