# Stockholm Visitor Guide

A collection of things to do and see in Stockholm. The headers below contain a selection of places, all places can also be viewed on the corresponding [Google Map](#google-map).

## Things to do
Stockholm changes a lot depending on the weather.

If it's sunny out, bring your swimming trunks and head out to the bars and take a dip after. Go to Systembolaget, grab some beers, some ice from a nearby shop, then head to a park and have a picknick!

If it's rainy, go to the museums or head to a cafe for a fika!

Nice rooftop bar in the central city.

### [Hermans](https://goo.gl/maps/5Q6G1svG3VrkpEhh9?coh=178571&entry=tt)

### [Palmyra Kebab](https://goo.gl/maps/raXryr1Jb4wCAt1a9?coh=178571&entry=tt)
Best kebab in Stockholm, a bit off though.

Fancier place for steak.

### [Günters](https://goo.gl/maps/jSBbjXNkVFSPuY2k8?coh=178571&entry=tt)

### [SNÖ](https://goo.gl/maps/7PGBicXiBndJ7JXm8?coh=178571&entry=tt)
Gelateria style ice cream in Vasastan. Expect long queues on sunny days, but it's worth it. They also have a great lunch!

## Nightlife
I'm not an expert on Stockholm night life, but these places are a good time. Avoid Stureplan at all costs.

### [Trädgården](https://goo.gl/maps/Du3ck7L5uRrjcfzHA?coh=178571&entry=tt)
Absolute must-visit club during the summer, best in June. 

### [Slaktkyrkan](https://goo.gl/maps/RJ4QRigUYSk56eD96?coh=178571&entry=tt)
More Berlin style club which is outside of the city.

### [Hornhuset](https://goo.gl/maps/zpUCMc9jMFNTnib58?coh=178571&entry=tt)
Good club on Söder, has a rooftop but no open-air style outdoor area unfortunately.
